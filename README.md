# Mechanical phone stand -  Mk 1

This phone gear was design with the constrain to move only using gears (and racks).

This phone holder is suitable for a phone with max dimension of 90x190x19 (a really big phone), and minimal of 60x40x__ (a tamagochi… ¯\_(ツ)_/¯)

When you put your phone on the stand, the vertical rack will move down and leads to all gear moving and grabing your phone from each side.

The top gears contains a spring, which mean that when you take off your phone, it will automatically come back to its default position.

All the design was compute using OpenScad using an homemade gears generator library.

I've learn a lot making this project, and I hope you like it!
Happy printing !
