# Mark I issue

 - Central rack is too high : Two to three tooth can't be remove from the central rack, for smaller design purpose

 - Spring gears don't hold in place : Spring gear are not constrained in top, driving to some "tooth jumping" when phone is removed from the support. 

 - Top and Bottom plate are too close : they are not spaced enought to allow free rotation of the gears

 - Side rack are loosy : they are on cantilever when the support is in default position, driving it to fall sometimes

 - Side rack interfere with phone removal

 - Front and bottom plate are too thin and don't allow a good fixation

 - Front and bottom plate aren't see though so some gear are not visible at all
